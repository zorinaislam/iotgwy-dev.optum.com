										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RARLAB has swiftly addressed a critical security vulnerability within its widely-used file compression software, WinRAR. This vulnerability posed a significant threat, enabling cybercriminals to execute commands on Windows PCs through the mere act of opening a maliciously crafted compressed file. Users of WinRAR are strongly advised to update to version 6.23 or a newer release promptly to safeguard their systems.</p>
<p>This security concern was initially brought to light by the security researcher known as goodbyeselene, who reported it on the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) platform, as detailed by Bleeping Computer. Notably, ZDI is managed by Trend Micro, an antivirus software company that rewards security researchers for identifying and reporting critical security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The ZDI log disclosed that the WinRAR flaw permitted &#8220;remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations&#8221; of WinRAR. Importantly, users are vulnerable only when they engage with a malicious file or visit an unsafe webpage. Given that RAR is a widely used format for compressed files, this vulnerability is not merely theoretical. Many individuals have encountered RAR files when attempting to download software, music, games, or movies from untrusted sources. In such cases, malicious actors could manipulate these RAR files in a manner that exploits the vulnerability, potentially infecting the user&#8217;s PC. The most reliable solution to mitigate this risk is to promptly update WinRAR, as RARLAB has already acknowledged and rectified this issue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s worth noting that the need for WinRAR may diminish for many PC users in the near future. Windows 11 is set to introduce native support for RAR archives, enabling users to create and extract RAR files without the necessity of WinRAR installation. This feature is already available for testing on Windows Insider builds, accessible via registration on the corresponding webpage.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to recognize that Insider builds of Windows are primarily intended for testing forthcoming features and should not serve as a substitute for stable versions of the operating system. These builds may contain significant bugs that could impact the usability of your PC. Therefore, users should be cautious of potential risks and perform backups of critical data before installing these builds.</p>
<p>Windows 11&#8217;s support for RAR files encompasses fundamental features that meet the needs of most users. Nonetheless, advanced users who frequently work with RAR archives may opt to continue using WinRAR. For those who do, updating to version 6.23 or a newer iteration of the software is highly advisable to ensure security and compatibility with the latest enhancements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mouse gestures are a fantastic way to supercharge your browsing experience by allowing you to navigate the web more efficiently. They provide a faster and more intuitive way to perform various actions while browsing, such as opening new tabs, closing tabs, navigating backward and forward, and refreshing pages. Here&#8217;s how you can get started with mouse gestures:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Install a Mouse Gesture Extension:</strong> Most modern web browsers offer extensions or add-ons that enable mouse gestures. Popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Opera have extensions you can install. Search for &#8220;mouse gesture extension&#8221; in your browser&#8217;s extension store and choose a well-rated one.</li>
<li><strong>Configure the Extension:</strong> After installing the extension, access its settings to configure it according to your preferences. You can usually customize the actions associated with different gestures and even create your own custom gestures.</li>
<li><strong>Learn the Basic Gestures:</strong> Typically, mouse gestures involve holding down the right mouse button and making a specific movement or pattern with your cursor. The most common gestures include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Right → Left:</strong> Go back to the previous page.</li>
<li><strong>Left → Right:</strong> Go forward to the next page (if available).</li>
<li><strong>Up → Down:</strong> Open a new tab.</li>
<li><strong>Down → Up:</strong> Close the current tab.</li>
<li><strong>Circle Clockwise:</strong> Refresh the current page.</li>
<li><strong>Circle Counter-Clockwise:</strong> Close the current tab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Practice and Customize:</strong> Spend some time practicing these basic gestures until they become second nature. You can also customize gestures to perform other actions like switching between tabs, opening specific websites, or activating browser functions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Some mouse gesture extensions offer advanced features, such as gesture drawing recognition, which allows you to create more complex and unique gestures for various tasks. Explore these features to further enhance your browsing experience.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If you encounter any issues or conflicts with other browser extensions, check the extension settings and try adjusting them or disabling conflicting extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Keep your mouse gesture extension up to date, as updates may bring improvements, bug fixes, and new features.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using mouse gestures effectively can significantly speed up your browsing workflow and reduce the need to use keyboard shortcuts or navigate through menus. It&#8217;s a great tool for power users who want to optimize their web browsing experience and save time while surfing the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of my last update in January 2022, Dropbox offered several features to help users organize and sort their files easily. One of the most useful features for sorting files in Dropbox is the ability to create and use folders, along with other file management tools. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to sort files in Dropbox using folders:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log into Dropbox</strong>: Open your Dropbox account in a web browser or use the Dropbox desktop or mobile app.</li>
<li><strong>Navigate to the Folder</strong>: Go to the location where you want to sort your files. You can either work within the main folder or create subfolders to further organize your files.</li>
<li><strong>Create a New Folder</strong> (if needed):
<ul>
<li>In the web browser: Click the &#8220;New&#8221; button and select &#8220;Folder.&#8221;</li>
<li>In the Dropbox app: Tap the &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;New&#8221; button, then choose &#8220;Folder.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Name Your Folder</strong>: Give your folder a descriptive name that represents the category or type of files you plan to store in it.</li>
<li><strong>Move or Upload Files</strong>:
<ul>
<li>To move existing files into the folder, simply click and drag them into the folder or select them and click the &#8220;Move&#8221; option.</li>
<li>To upload new files directly into the folder, click the &#8220;Upload&#8221; or &#8220;Add files&#8221; button and select the files you want to add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Organize Subfolders</strong>: If necessary, you can create additional subfolders within folders to create a hierarchical structure for your files.</li>
<li><strong>Use File Names and Descriptions</strong>: Ensure that your files are appropriately named and consider adding descriptions or tags to help you easily identify them.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize Dropbox&#8217;s Search Feature</strong>: If you have a large number of files, you can use Dropbox&#8217;s search feature to quickly locate specific files by name, type, or content.</li>
<li><strong>Use Labels and Comments</strong> (if applicable): Dropbox also allows you to use labels and comments on files to provide additional context and organization.</li>
<li><strong>Regularly Review and Maintain</strong>: Periodically go through your files and folders to make sure they remain organized. Delete or move files as needed to maintain an organized structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dropbox may have introduced new features and improvements after my last update in 2022, so it&#8217;s a good idea to explore their official website or check their user guides for the most up-to-date information on sorting and organizing files.</p>
